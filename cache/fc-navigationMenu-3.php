Most scholarly journals require an abstract. Consult the instructions to authors or web page of the journal to which you plan to submit your article for any journal-specific instructions. A well-prepared abstract can be the most important single paragraph in an article. Most people have their first contact with an article by seeing just the abstract, usually in comparison with several other abstracts, as they are doing a literature search. Readers frequently decide on the basis of the abstract whether to read the entire article. The abstract needs to be dense with information. By embedding key words in your abstract, you enhance the user\\u2019s ability to find it. Do not exceed the abstract word limit of the journal to which you are submitting your article. Word limits vary from journal to journal and typically range from 150 to 250 words. For information on how abstracts are used to retrieve articles, consult Record Structure for APA Databases (Sick, 2009).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Keywords:<\\/strong> low case, comma, paper template, abstract, keywords, introduction<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li><strong> Introduction<\\/strong><\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<p><em>1.1 Introduce the Problem<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The body of a manuscript opens with an introduction that presents the specific problem under study and describes the research strategy. Because the introduction is clearly identified by its position in the manuscript, it does not carry a heading labeling it the introduction. Before writing the introduction, consider the following questions (Beck &amp; Sales, 2001, p. 100):<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Why is this problem important?<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>How does the study relate to previous work in the area? If other aspects of this study have been reported previously, how does this report differ from, and build on, the earlier report?<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>What are the primary and secondary hypotheses and objectives of the study, and what, if any, are the links to theory?<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>How do the hypotheses and research design relate to one another?<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>What are the theoretical and practical implications of the study?<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>A good introduction answers these questions in just a few pages and, by summarizing the relevant arguments and the past evidence, gives the reader a firm sense of What was done and why (Beck &amp; Sales, 2001, pp. 100-102).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>1.2 Explore Importance of the Problem<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>State why the problem deserves new research. For basic research, the statement about importance might involve the need to resolve any inconsistency in results of past work and\\/or extend the reach of a theoretical formulation. For applied research, this might involve the need to solve a social problem or treat a psychological disorder. When research is driven by the desire to resolve controversial issues, all sides in the debate should be represented in balanced measure in the introduction. Avoid animosity and ad hominem arguments in presenting the controversy. Conclude the statement of the problem in the introduction with a brief but formal statement of the purpose of the research that summarizes the material preceding it. For literature reviews as well as theoretical and methodological articles, also clearly state the reasons that the reported content is important and how the article fits into the cumulative understanding of the field.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>1.3 Describe Relevant Scholarship<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Discuss the relevant related literature, but do not feel compelled to include an exhaustive historical account. Assume that the reader is knowledgeable about the basic problem and does not require a complete accounting of its history. A scholarly description of earlier work in the introduction provides a summary of the most recent directly related work and recognizes the priority of the work of others. Citation of and specific credit to relevant earlier works are signs of scientific and scholarly responsibility and are essential for the growth of a cumulative science. In the description of relevant scholarship, also inform readers whether other aspects of this study have been reported on previously and how the current use of the evidence differs from earlier uses. At the same time, cite and reference only works pertinent to the specific issue and not those that are of only tangential or general significance. When summarizing earlier works, avoid nonessential details; instead, emphasize pertinent findings, relevant methodological issues, and major conclusions. Refer the reader to general surveys or research syntheses of the topic if they are available. Demonstrate the logical continuity between previous and present work. Develop the problem with enough breadth and clarity to make it generally understood by as wide a professional audience as possible (Beck &amp; Sales, 2001). Do not let the goal of brevity lead you to write a statement intelligible only to the specialist.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>1.4 State Hypotheses and Their Correspondence to Research Design<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>After you have introduced the problem and have developed the background material, explain your approach to solving the problem. In empirical studies, this usually involves stating your hypotheses or specific question and describing how these were derived from theory or are logically connected to previous data and argumentation. Clearly develop the rationale for each. Also, if you have some hypotheses or questions that are central to your purpose and others that are secondary or exploratory, state this prioritization. Explain how the research design permits the inferences needed to examine the hypothesis or provide estimates in answer to the question.<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol start=\\"2\\">\\r\\n<li><strong> Method<\\/strong><\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<p>The Method section describes in detail how the study was conducted, including conceptual and operational definitions of the variables used in the study, Different types of studies will rely on different methodologies; however, a complete description of the methods used enables the reader to evaluate the appropriateness of your methods and the reliability and the validity of your results, It also permits experienced investigators to replicate the study, If your manuscript is an update of an ongoing or earlier study and the method has been published in detail elsewhere, you may refer the reader to that source and simply give a brief synopsis of the method in this section.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>2.1 Identify Subsections<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is both conventional and expedient to divide the Method section into labeled subsections. These usually include a section with descriptions of the participants or subjects and a section describing the procedures used in the study. The latter section often includes description of (a) any experimental manipulations or interventions used and how they were delivered-for example, any mechanical apparatus used to deliver them; (b) sampling procedures and sample size and precision; (c) measurement approaches (including the psychometric properties of the instruments used); and (d) the research design. If the design of the study is complex or the stimuli require detailed description, additional subsections or subheadings to divide the subsections may be warranted to help readers find specific information.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Include in these subsections the information essential to comprehend and replicate the study. Insufficient detail leaves the reader with questions; too much detail burdens the reader with irrelevant information. Consider using appendices and\\/or a supplemental website for more detailed information.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>2.2 Participant (Subject) Characteristics<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Appropriate identification of research participants is critical to the science and practice of psychology, particularly for generalizing the findings, making comparisons across replications, and using the evidence in research syntheses and secondary data analyses. If humans participated in the study, report the eligibility and exclusion criteria, including any restrictions based on demographic characteristics.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>2.3 Sampling Procedures<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Describe the procedures for selecting participants, including (a) the sampling method, if a systematic sampling plan was used; (b) the percentage of the sample approached that participated; and (c) the number of participants who selected themselves into the sample. Describe the settings and locations in which the data were collected as well as any agreements and payments made to participants, agreements with the institutional review board, ethical standards met, and safety monitoring procedures.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>2.3.1 Sample Size, Power, and Precision<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Along with the description of subjects, give the mended size of the sample and number of individuals meant to be in each condition if separate conditions were used. State whether the achieved sample differed in known ways from the target population. Conclusions and interpretations should not go beyond what the sample would warrant.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>2.3.2 Measures and Covariates<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Include in the Method section information that provides definitions of all primary and secondary outcome measures and covariates, including measures collected but not included in this report. Describe the methods used to collect data (e.g., written questionnaires, interviews, observations) as well as methods used to enhance the quality of the measurements (e.g., the training and reliability of assessors or the use of multiple observations). Provide information on instruments used, including their psychometric and biometric properties and evidence of cultural validity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>2.3.3 Research Design<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Specify the research design in the Method section. Were subjects placed into conditions that were manipulated, or were they observed naturalistically? If multiple conditions were created, how were participants assigned to conditions, through random assignment or some other selection mechanism? Was the study conducted as a between-subjects or a within-subject design?<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>2.3.4 Experimental Manipulations or Interventions<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If interventions or experimental manipulations were used in the study, describe their specific content. Include the details of the interventions or manipulations intended for each study condition, including control groups (if any), and describe how and when interventions (experimental manipulations) were actually administered.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The text size of formula should be similar with normal text size. The formula should be placed in the middle and serial number on the right.

Report the data in sufficient detail to justify your conclusions. Mention all relevant results, including those that run counter to expectation; be sure to include small effect sizes (or statistically nonsignificant findings) when theory predicts large (or statistically significant) ones. Do not hide uncomfortable results by omission. Do not include individual scores or raw data with the exception, for example, of single-case designs or illustrative examples. In the spirit of data sharing (encouraged by APA and other professional associations and sometimes required by funding agencies), raw data, including study characteristics and indivldual effect sizes used in a meta -analysis, can be made available on supplemental online archives.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>3.1<\\/em> <em>Recruitment<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Provide dates defining the periods of recruitment and follow-up and the pnmary sources of the potential subjects, where appropriate.

Accurate, unbiased, complete, and insightful reporting of the analytic treatment of data (be it quantitative or qualitative) must be a component of all research reports. Researchers in the field of psychology use numerous approaches to the analysis of data, and no one approach is uniformly preferred as long as the method is appropriate to the research questions being asked and the nature of the data collected. The methods used must support their analytic burdens, including robustness to violations of the assumptions that underlie them, and they must provide clear, unequivocal insights into the data.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>3.3 Ancillary Analyses<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Report any other analyses performed, including subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses, indicating those that were pre-specified and those that were exploratory (though not necessarily in the level of detail of primary analyses). Consider putting the detailed results of these analyses on the supplemental online archive. Discuss the implications, if any, of the ancillary analyses for statistical error rates.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>3.4<\\/em> <em>Participant Flow<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For experimental and quasi-experimental designs, there must be a description of the flow of participants (human, animal, or units such as classrooms or hospital wards) through the study. Present the total number of units recruited into the study and the number of participants assigned to each group. Provide the number of participants who did not complete the experiment or crossed over to other conditions and explain why. Note the number of participants used in the primary analyses.

Here you will examine, interpret, and qualify the results and draw inferences and conclusions from them. Emphasize any theoretical or practical consequences of the results. (When the discussion is relatively brief and straightforward, some authors prefer to combine it with the Results section, creating a section called Results and Discussion.)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Open the Discussion section with a clear statement of the support or nonsupport for your original hypotheses, distinguished by primary and secondary hypotheses. If hypotheses were not supported, offer post hoc explanations. Similarities and differences between your results and the work of others should be used to contextualize, confirm, and clarify your conclusions. Do not simply reformulate and repeat points already made; each new statement should contribute to your interpretation and to the reader\\u2019s understanding of the problem.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Your interpretation of the results should take into account (a) sources of potential bias and other threats to internal validity, (b) the imprecision of measures, (c) the overall number of tests or overlap among tests, (d) the effect sizes observed, and (e) other limitations or weaknesses of the study. If an intervention is involved, discuss whether it was successful and the mechanism by which it was intended to work (causal pathways) and\\/or alternative mechanisms. Also, discuss barriers to implementing the intervention or manipulation as well as the fidelity with which the intervention or manip ulation was implemented in the study, that is, any differences between the manipulation as planned and as implemented.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Acknowledge the limitations of your research, and address alternative explanations of the results. Discuss the generalizability, or external validity, of the findings. This critical analysis should take into account differences between the target population and the accessed sample. For interventions, discuss characteristics that make them more or less applicable to circumstances not included in the study, how and what outcomes were measured (relative to other measures that might have been used), the length of time to measurement (between the end of the intervention and the measurement of outcomes), incentives, compliance rates, and specific settings involved in the study as well as other contextual issues.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>End the Discussion section with a reasoned and justifiable commentary on the importance of your findings. This concluding section may be brief or extensive provided that it is tightly reasoned, self-contained, and not overstated. In this section, you might briefly return to a discussion of why the problem is important (as stated in the introduction); what larger issues, those that transcend the particulars of the subfield, might hinge on the findings; and what propositions are confirmed or disconfirmed by the extrapolation of these findings to such overarching issues.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You may also consider the following issues:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>What is the theoretical, clinical, or practical significance of the outcomes, and what is the basis for these interpretations? If the findings are valid and replicable, what real-life psychological phenomena might be explained or modeled by the results? Are applications warranted on the basis of this research? (Note 1)<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>What problems remain unresolved or arise anew because of these findings? The responses to these questions are the core of the contribution of your study and justify why readers both inside and outside your own specialty should attend to the findings. Your readers should receive clear, unambiguous, and direct answers.

Some examples of material suitable for an appendix are (a) a list of stimulus materials (e.g., those used in psycholinguistic research), (b) a detailed description of a complex piece of equipment, (c) a list of articles that provided the source data for a meta-analysis but are not directly referred to in any other way in an article, and (d) a detailed demographic description of subpopulations in the study and other detailed and\\/or complex reporting items suggested in the reporting standards section of this chapter.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If your manuscript has only one appendix, label it Appendix; if your manuscript has more than one appendix, label each one with a capital letter (Appendix A, Appendix B, etc.) in the order in which it is mentioned in the main text. Each appendix must have a title. In the text, refer to appendices by their labels: produced the same results for both studies (see Appendices A and B for complete proofs).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Appendix B <\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>The Heading to Appendix B<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Like the main text, an appendix may include headings and subheadings as well as tables, figures, and displayed equations. Number each appendix table and figure, and number displayed equations if necessary for later reference; precede the number with the letter of the appendix in which it is included (e.g., Table A1). In a sole appendix, which is not labeled with a letter, precede all tables, figures, and equation numbers with the letter A to distinguish them from those of the main text.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Table B1.

The review process may take four to ten weeks.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>c) Notification of the result of review by e-mail.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>d) If the submission is accepted, the authors revise accordingly and pay the Article Processing Fee (for formatting and hosting).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>e) A PDF version of the article is available for download on the journal\\u2019s webpage free of charge.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>f) From July 1, 2018, we will not automatically provide authors free print journals. We will provide free print copies for authors who really need them. Authors are requested to kindly fill a application form to request free print copies. Additionally, we are happy to provide the journal\\u2019s eBook in PDF format for authors, free of charge. This is the same as the printed version.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<h2>1. General Requirements<\\/h2>\\r\\n<h3>1.1 Language and Numbers<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Please write your text in proper English; American or British usage is accepted, but not a mixture of both. When writing numbers, use a period, not a comma, to represent the decimal point and a space to separate numbers of more than five digits into groups of three, whether on the left or the right of the decimal point (i.e., 10 000.471 85, but 1000.4718). We only accept manuscripts written in English.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>1.2 Length of Paper<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Papers between 6 000 and 10 000 words are preferred.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>2. Title Page<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>To ensure the integrity of the peer review process, every effort should be made to prevent the identities of the authors and reviewers from being known to each other.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you upload a submission file, author identities should be removed from it. You should upload the title page as a supplementary file for the editor to review.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>2.1 Title<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Be concise and informative. The title is often used in information-retrieval systems and should be no more than 12 words in length and not contain abbreviations or words that serve no purpose. If you choose to have a subtitle, it should be italicized and centered directly below the main title.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>2.2 Authors\\u2019 Names and Affiliations<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The preferred form of an author\\u2019s name is first name, middle initial(s), and last name; this form reduces the likelihood of mistaken identity. To assist researchers as well as librarians, use the same form for publication throughout your career; that is, do not use initials on one manuscript and your full name on a later one. Determining whether Juanita A. Smith is the same person as J. A. Smith, J. Smith, or A. Smith can be difficult, particularly when citations span several years and institutional affiliations. Omit all titles (e.g., Dr., Professor) and degrees (e.g., PhD, PsyD, EdD).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The authors\\u2019 affiliation identifies the location of the author(s) at the time the research was conducted, which is usually an institution. Include a dual affiliation only if two institutions contributed substantial support to the study. Include no more than two affiliations per author. If an author has no institutional affiliation, list the city and state of his\\/her residence. The names of the authors should appear in the order of their contributions, centered between the side margins. For names with suffixes (e,g., Jr. and II), separate the suffix from the rest of the name with a space instead of a comma. Only provide a complete mailing address of the corresponding author for correspondence.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>Example:<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Anne Smith<sup>1<\\/sup>, Mary A.

Preparation of Text<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Manuscripts should be organized in the following order:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Title; abstract; keywords (indexing terms, normally three-to-six items); introduction; material studied, area descriptions, methods and\\/or techniques; results; discussion; conclusion; acknowledgements; references.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>3.1 General Rules for Text<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Please use the following rules for the entire text, including abstract, keywords, headings, and references.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Font: Times New Roman; Size: 10 pt.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Paragraph Spacing: Above paragraph \\u2014 0 pt.; below paragraph \\u2014 4 pt.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Line Spacing: fixed, 12 pt.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Heading 1: Times New Roman; 10 pt.; Bold; for example, 1. First-level Heading<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Heading 2: Times New Roman; 10 pt.; Italic; for example, <em>1.1 Second-level Heading<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Heading 3: Times New Roman; 10 pt.; for example, 1.1.1 Third-level Heading<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>3.2 Abstract<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>A concise and factual abstract is required. It should be between 150 and 250 words. The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results, and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. References should therefore be avoided, but, if essential, they must be cited in full in the abstract without relying on the reference list.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>3.3 Keywords<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Immediately after the abstract, provide 3-10 keywords in alphabetical order, avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (e.g., \\u201cand,\\u201d \\u201cof\\u201d). Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. Listing your keywords will help researchers find your work in databases.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>3.4 Subdivision of the Article<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections (e.g., 1., 2., 3., etc.). Subsections should be numbered 1.1, 1.2, etc., and sub-subsections should be numbered 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc. Note that the abstract is not included in section numbering. Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to \\u201cthe text.\\u201d Any subsection, ideally, should not be more than 600 words. Authors are urged to write as concisely as possible but not at the expense of clarity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>3.5 Equations<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The text size of equations should be similar to normal text size. The formula should be placed center justified with serial number on the right. For example:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>a=[(1+b)\\/x]<sup>1\\/2<\\/sup><\\/em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>3.6 Tables<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text. Place a table\\u2019s caption above the table\\u2019s body and its description below the body. Avoid vertical rules. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in tables do not duplicate results described elsewhere in the article.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For example:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Table 1. Estimated Distance (cm) for Letter and Digit Stimuli<\\/p>\\r\\n<table>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td colspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"284\\">\\r\\n<p>95%CI<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>Condition<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p><em>M<\\/em>(<em>SD<\\/em>)<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>LL<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>UL<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>Letters<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>14.5(28.6)<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>5.4<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>23.6<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>Digits<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>31.8(33.2)<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>21.2<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td width=\\"142\\">\\r\\n<p>42.4<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/tbody>\\r\\n<\\/table>\\r\\n<p><em>Note<\\/em>.

Place a figure\\u2019s caption and description below the figure body. A minimum resolution of 300 DPI is required. You may resize the figures or schemes to fit the page size.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<table>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td width=\\"85\\">&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/tbody>\\r\\n<\\/table>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Figure 1. Figure Title<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>Note.<\\/em> Avoid abbreviating the titles of tables, figures, and equations (i.e., Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Eq. 3) in the caption or in running text. Do not write \\u201cthe table above\\/below\\u201d or \\u201cthe figure on page 32,\\u201d because the position and page number of a table or figure cannot be determined until the pages are typeset.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>4. References<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Cite the work of those individuals whose ideas, theories, or research have directly influenced your work. They may provide key background information, support or dispute your thesis, or offer critical definitions and data. Citation of an article implies that you have personally read the cited work. In addition to crediting the ideas of others that you used to build your thesis, provide documentation for all facts and figures that are not considered common knowledge.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>4.1 Citations in the Text<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Each reference cited in the text must appear in the reference list, and each entry in the reference list must be cited in the text. However, two kinds of material are cited only in the text: references to classical works such as the Bible and the Qur\\u2019an, whose sections are standardized across editions, and references to personal communication. References in a meta-analysis are not cited in-text unless they are also mentioned in the text.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When formatting an in-text citation, give, in parentheses, the last name of the author of the cited work and the year it was published. For unpublished or informally published works, give the year the work was produced. Write \\u201cin press\\u201d in parentheses for articles that have been accepted for publication but that have not yet been published. Do not give a date until the article has actually been published.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In all other instances, citations in the text should follow the referencing style used by the American Psychological Association.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>Examples:<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><em>A Work by Two Authors<\\/em><\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Name both authors in the signal phrase or in the parentheses each time you cite the work.

Any further information (author names, dates, reference to a source publication, etc.), if known, should also be given. Web references can be listed separately (e.g., after the reference list) under a different heading if desired, or they can be included in the reference list.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>4.3 Reference List<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Please find the below information for basic rules in a reference list.<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Each entry in your reference list should be defined by a hanging indent of two characters.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Authors\\u2019 names are inverted (last name first); give the last name and initials for all authors of a particular work if it has three to seven authors. If the work has more than seven authors, list the first six authors and then use ellipses after the sixth author\\u2019s name. After the ellipses, list the last author\\u2019s name of the work. Use \\u201c&amp;\\u201d instead of \\u201cand\\u201d when listing multiple authors of a single work.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Reference list entries should be alphabetized by the last name of the first author of each work.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>If you have more than one article by the same author, single-author references or multiple-author references with the exact same authors in the exact same order are listed in order by the year of publication, starting with the earliest.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Capitalize all major words in journal titles.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>When referring to any work that is not a journal, such as a book, article, or Web page, capitalize only the first letter of the first word of a title and subtitle, the first word after a colon or a dash in the title, and proper nouns. Do not capitalize the first letter of the second word in a hyphenated compound word.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>4.4 DOIs in References<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The journal\\/publisher encourages authors to cite those items (journal articles, conference proceedings, book chapters, technical reports, working papers, dissertations, etc.) that have DOIs. When the cited items have DOIs, the authors should add DOI persistent links to the regular references. The DOI persistent links should be the last elements in the references. The persistent links should be active.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Format of persistent link: https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/+DOI<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Example of persistent link: https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1109\\/2.901164<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The authors or editors may retrieve articles\\u2019 DOIs at http:\\/\\/www.crossref.org\\/SimpleTextQuery\\/.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can register a free account to start retrieving articles\\u2019 DOIs.

The publisher is also responsible for ensuring that the publication system works smoothly, and that ethical guidelines are applied to assist the editor, author, and reviewer in performing their ethical duties.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Editor\'s Responsibilities<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The editor should acknowledge receipt of submitted manuscripts within two working days of receipt and ensure an efficient, fair, and timely review process.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The editor should ensure that submitted manuscripts are processed in a confidential manner, and that no content of the manuscripts will be disclosed to anyone other than the corresponding author, reviewers, and the publisher, as appropriate.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The editor should recuse himself or herself from processing manuscripts if he or she has any conflict of interest with any of the authors or institutions related to the manuscripts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The editor should not disclose the names and other details of the reviewers to a third party without the permission of the reviewers.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The editor has the right to make the final decision on whether to accept or reject a manuscript with reference to the significance, originality, and clarity of the manuscript and its relevance to the journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The editor should by no means make any effort to oblige the authors to cite his or her journal either as an implied or explicit condition of accepting their manuscripts for publication.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The editor should not use for his or her own research any part of any data or work reported in submitted and as yet unpublished articles.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The editor should respond promptly and take reasonable measures when an ethical complaint occurs concerning a submitted manuscript or a published paper, and the editor should immediately contact and consult with the author. In this case, a written formal retraction or correction may also be required.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Reviewer\'s Responsibilities<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The reviewer who feels unqualified to review the assigned manuscript or affirms that he or she cannot meet the deadline for completion of the review should immediately notify the editor and excuse himself or herself from the process of reviewing this manuscript.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The reviewer should inform the editor and recuse himself or herself from reviewing the manuscript if there is a conflict of interest. Specifically, the reviewer should recuse himself or herself from reviewing any manuscript authored or coauthored by a person with whom the reviewer has an obvious personal or academic relationship, if the relationship could introduce bias or the reasonable perception of bias.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The reviewer should treat the manuscript in a confidential manner. The manuscript should not be disclosed to or discussed with others except as authorized by the editor.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The reviewer should approach the peer-review job objectively. Personal criticism of the author is unacceptable.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The reviewer should not use for his or her own research any part of any data or work reported in submitted and as yet unpublished articles.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The reviewer should immediately notify the editor of any similarities between the manuscript under review and another paper either published or under consideration by another journal. The reviewer should immediately call to the editor\\u2019s attention a manuscript containing plagiarized material or falsified data.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Author\'s Responsibilities<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The author should not submit concurrent manuscripts (or manuscripts essentially describing the same subject matter) to multiple journals. Likewise, an author should not submit any paper previously published anywhere to the journals for consideration. The publication of articles on specific subject matter, such as clinical guidelines and translations, in more than one journal is acceptable if certain conditions are met.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The author should present a precise and brief report of his or her research and an impartial description of its significance.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The author should honestly gather and interpret his or her research data. Publishers, editors, reviewers, and readers are entitled to request the author to provide the raw data for his or her research for convenience of editorial review and public access. If practicable, the author should retain such data for any possible use after publication.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The author should guarantee that the works he or she has submitted are original. If the author has used work and\\/or words by others, appropriate citations are required. Plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The author should indicate explicitly all sources that have supported the research and also declare any conflict(s) of interest.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The author should give due acknowledgement to all of those who have made contributions to the research. Those who have contributed significantly to the research should be listed as coauthors. The author should ensure that all coauthors have affirmed the final version of the paper and have agreed on its final publication.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The author should promptly inform the journal editor of any obvious error(s) in his or her published paper and cooperate earnestly with the editor in retraction or correction of the paper. If the editor is notified by any party other than the author that the published paper contains an obvious error, the author should write a retraction or make the correction based on the medium of publication.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>"},"remoteUrl":{"en_US":""},"title":{"en_US":"Publishing Ethics"}},"_hasLoadableAdapters":false,"_metadataExtractionAdapters":[],"_extractionAdaptersLoaded":false,"_metadataInjectionAdapters":[],"_injectionAdaptersLoaded":false,"navigationMenuItems":[],"_isDisplayed":true,"_isChildVisible":false},"children":[]},{"_data":{"id":235,"menuId":3,"menuItemId":30,"parentId":25,"seq":11},"_hasLoadableAdapters":false,"_metadataExtractionAdapters":[],"_extractionAdaptersLoaded":false,"_metadataInjectionAdapters":[],"_injectionAdaptersLoaded":false,"navigationMenuItem":{"_data":{"id":30,"contextId":1,"type":"NMI_TYPE_CUSTOM","path":"ap-charges","content":{"en_US":"<h3 style=\\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;\\">Publication Fee<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p style=\\"margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;\\">The journal does not charge any publication fee.
